 Implemented a new method `linkedListToArray` in the LinkedListToArray class to convert a LinkedList to an array.
- The method iterates through each element of the linked list and copies them into a new array.
- Added null handling to ensure consistent behavior when the linked list contains null elements.
- Updated the main method in LinkedListToArray class to demonstrate the usage of the new method.
- Included unit tests to verify the correctness of the `linkedListToArray` method under various scenarios, including empty list, single-element list, and list with multiple elements.
